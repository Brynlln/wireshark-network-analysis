## Wireshark Network Analysis

This project demonstrates hands-on network traffic analysis using Wireshark.
It includes real packet captures (PCAPs) and screenshots documenting protocol behavior.

### DNS Resolution Analysis
- Captured live DNS traffic over UDP port 53
- Identified standard DNS query structure and transaction IDs
- Observed FQDN resolution from domain name to IP address
- Analyzed protocol stack: Ethernet → IP → UDP → DNS

### Repository Structure
- pcaps/        Filtered packet capture files (.pcapng)
- screenshots/ Annotated screenshots from Wireshark analysis

### Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Windows

### Purpose
This project was created to demonstrate practical packet analysis skills
relevant to entry-level networking and cybersecurity roles.
